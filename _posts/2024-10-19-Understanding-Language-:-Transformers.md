## Introduction

After some time away, we are back! This time, we are going to understand the idea of modelling human language through the framework of Machine Learning. More specifically, the most widely known and the most commercialized method of application for this task is the Large Language Model. This is basically a term for a machine learning model having many parameters that attempts to model human language. In the present, the underlying model that is used to implement this is the "Transformer". The whole model has been described and explained in its entirety in the paper title "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et. al.
